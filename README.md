The repository contains the work of our team on creating a traffic simulator.

# Project participants

* Postica Denis - simulation of traffic light, synchronization between cars and traffic lights.

#What we have implemented 
* Simulataion of a traffic light for an intersection with 4 traffic lights;
* The user should be able to increase the speed of traffic light(using wheel);
* The user may be able to increase the number of generated random cars (pressing left click to appear a new random car); 
* 4 crosswalks;
* All rules in intersection are respected;
